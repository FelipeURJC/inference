    "- If mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn’t very large.\n",
    "- Are mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and doesn’t offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.\n",
    "- The study’s authors also found that mammograms led to overdiagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients’ lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that overdiagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients."
