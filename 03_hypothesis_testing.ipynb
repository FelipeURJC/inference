In the experiment, about a thousand volunteers (all Facebook users) were randomly allocated to either a treatment group ($X$), in which they told not to use Facebook for one week, or a control group ($Y$), in which they carried on using Facebook as normal. At the end of the week, all participants completed a questionnaire. One of the questions asked them to record, “*In general, how satisfied are you with your life today?*” on a scale of 1 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied). Let  $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$ be the observed responses in the treatment group, and $y_1,y_2,\\ldots,y_n$ be the observed responses in the control group.
